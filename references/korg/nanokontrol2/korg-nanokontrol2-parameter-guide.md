## Settings in CC mode......................................................................................................................

# Settings in CC mode

Here’s how to adjust settings if you’ve chosen “CC” as the operating mode.

### Control group

Each group containing a knob, slider, and three buttons (Solo, Mute, Rec) is collectively called a “control group.”
The nanoKONTROL2 has eight control groups.

**Group MIDI Channel [1...16/Global]**

For each control group, this specifies the MIDI channel of the MIDI messages that are transmitted by that control group. This should be set to match the MIDI channel of the
application that you’re controlling. If you choose “Global,” messages will be transmitted on the MIDI channel specified by the **_Global MIDI Channel_** setting (p.4).


## Settings in CC mode

### Knobs

```
A control change message will be transmitted when you use a knob.
You can enable or disable each knob, specify its control change number, and specify the values that will be transmitted when the knob is
turned to the far left or far right.
```
```
Knob Enable [Disable/Enable]
This enables or disables the knob.
If you choose “Disable,” no MIDI message will be transmitted when you use the knob.
```
```
CC Number [0...127]
This specifies the control change number of the control change message that will be transmitted.
```
```
Left Value [0...127]
This specifies the value of the control change message that will be transmitted when the knob is turned to the far left.
```
```
Right Value [0...127]
This specifies the value of the control change message that will be transmitted when the knob is turned to the far right.
```
### Sliders

```
A control change message will be transmitted when you use a slider.
You can enable or disable each slider, specify its control change number, and specify the values that will be transmitted when the slider is
moved to the top or bottom.
```
```
Slider Enable [Disable/Enable]
This enables or disables the slider.
If you choose “Disable,” no MIDI message will be transmitted when you use the slider.
```
```
CC Number [0...127]
This specifies the control change number of the control change message that will be transmitted.
```

## Settings in CC mode

```
Lower Value [0...127]
This specifies the value of the control change message that will be transmitted when the slider is moved to the bottom.
```
```
Upper Value [0...127]
This specifies the value of the control change message that will be transmitted when the slider is moved to the top.
```
### Solo buttons/Mute buttons/Rec buttons

```
When you use these buttons, a control change message or a note message will be transmitted, according to the Assign Type that you’ve
specified.
You can specify the message that’s assigned to each button, how the button will function, the control change number or note number, and the
values that are transmitted when the button is turned on or off.
```
```
Assign Type [No Assign/Control Change/Note]
This specifies the type of message that’s assigned to each button. You can assign nothing, a control change message, or a note message.
```
```
Button Behavior [Momentary/Toggle]
This specifies how the button will operate.
Momentary A message with the On Value or Note On will be transmitted when you press the button, and a message with the Off
Value or Note Off will be transmitted when you release the button.
Toggle A message with the On Value or Note On and a message with the Off Value or Note Off will be transmitted alternately
each time you press the button.
```
```
CC/Note Number [0...127/C-1...G9]
This specifies the control change number of the control change message or the note number of the note message that is transmitted.
```
```
Off Value [0...127]
This specifies the value of the message that will be transmitted when the button turns off.
This can be set only if Assign Type is “Control Change.”
```
```
On Value [0...127]
This specifies the value of the message that will be transmitted when the button turns on.
```

## Settings in CC mode

```
If the Assign Type is “Note,” the note-on message will be transmitted with the On Value as the velocity. If the On Value is “0,” the
velocity will be transmitted as “1”.
```
### Transport buttons/Function buttons

```
By using the transport buttons or function buttons, you can transmit control change messages or note messages, depending on the assign
type that you've chosen. For each of these eleven buttons, you can specify a message to assign, how the button will function, the control
change number, the note number, and the values that are transmitted when the button is turned on or off.
```
```
Transport Button MIDI Channel [1...16/Global]
This specifies the MIDI channel of the MIDI messages that are transmitted by these buttons. This should be set to match the MIDI channel
of the application that you're controlling. If you choose “Global,” messages will be transmitted on the MIDI channel specified by the Global
MIDI Channel setting (p.4).
The Transport Button MIDI Channel setting is common to all eleven of these buttons.
```
```
Assign Type [No Assign/Control Change/Note]
This specifies the type of message that’s assigned to each button. You can assign nothing, a control change message, or a note message.
```
```
Button Behavior [Momentary/Toggle]
This specifies how the button will function.
Momentary A message with the On Value or Note On will be transmitted when you press the button, and a message with the Off
Value or Note Off will be transmitted when you release the button.
Toggle A message with the On Value or Note On and a message with the Off Value or Note Off will be transmitted alternately
each time you press the button.
```
```
CC/Note Number [0...127/C-1...G9]
This specifies the control change number of the control change message or the note number of the note message that is transmitted.
```
```

This specifies the value of the message that will be transmitted when the button turns off.
This can only be set if the Assign Type is “Control Change.”
```

## Settings in CC mode

```
On Value [0...127]
This specifies the value of the message that will be transmitted when the button turns on.
If the Assign Type is “Note,” the note-on message will be transmitted with the On Value as the velocity. If the On Value is “0,” the
velocity will be transmitted as “1”.
```
### LED mode

This lets you specify how the LEDs of the transport buttons and the Solo button, Mute button, and Rec button of the control groups will light-up.
This setting specifies how the lit/unlit status of the LEDs will be controlled.

**LED Mode [Internal/External]**

This specifies how the button’s LED will be controlled.
**Internal** The LED will be lit or unlit according to the button’s on/off status.

**External** The LED will light-up or go dark when a message with the control change number or note number that’s assigned to that button is r eceived from the
computer. The LED will light-up when an On Value or Note On message is received, and will go dark when an Off Value or Note Off message is received.


## Operation in DAW control mode.................................................................................................

# Operation in DAW control mode

```

## Restoring the factory settings....................................................................................................

# Restoring the factory settings

By turning on the power while holding down the PREV TRACK button, NEXT TRACK button, and CYCLE button, you can return the nanoKONTROL2’s settings to their
original factory-set default state. The transport buttons except the CYCLE button will then blink.

```
The process of restoring the factory settings will take a few seconds after you turn on the power. Never turn off the power during this time.
```

## Troubleshooting...........................................................................................................................

# Troubleshooting

## •Your application does not respond to MIDI messages sent from the nanoKONTROL

- Make sure that the MIDI channel of the messages that are transmitted by the nanoKONTROL2 matches the MIDI channel of your application.
- When using the nanoKONTROL2 with DAW software, you’ll need to set the DAW to use the nanoKONTROL2. Select the appropriate settings as described in the
    nanoKONTROL2 owner’s manual section “Operating mode” and in the documentation for your DAW software.

## • Buttons do not function as indicated on the nanoKONTROL2 itself

- The application that you’re using might not support some of the functions, or the operations might be different.
- Make sure that the nanoKONTROL2’s “Operating mode” is set appropriately for the application that you’re using.

## • LED does not light-up when you use a button that has an LED

- Check the **_Control Mode_** (p.4) and **_LED Mode_** (p.9) settings.
